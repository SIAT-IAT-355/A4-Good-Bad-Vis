## Objective
In this assignment, you will explore the concepts of good and bad data visualizations. You will find, analyze, and transform visualizations, followed by creating your own visualizations using the provided movie dataset. The goal is to understand what makes a visualization effective and how poor design choices can lead to misinterpretation.

## Instructions

### 1. Find One Good Visualization and Turn It into a Bad One
- Find an example of a **good** data visualization from any public source (e.g., [Observable](https://observablehq.com/collection/@observablehq/featured-creators), [D3 Gallery](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery), books, articles).
- Include a **screenshot** of this visualization in your report and write a brief analysis explaining:
  - Why it’s effective.
  - What design principles are being followed.
  - How the visualization communicates the data clearly and efficiently.

- **Transform it into a bad visualization** by intentionally introducing poor design choices (e.g., improper chart types, bad labels, misleading colors).
- Submit both the original **good** visualization and your **bad** version, along with a brief explanation of the changes you made and why they lead to a poor visualization.

### 2. Find One Bad Visualization and Turn It into a Good One
- Find an example of a **bad** data visualization from any public source (e.g., books, articles), but **avoid** using examples already labeled as bad on the internet (e.g., from "classic bad examples" lists). You are expected to detect poor visualizations yourself.
- Include a **screenshot** of this visualization in your report and write a brief analysis explaining:
  - Why it’s ineffective or misleading.
  - What poor design choices are being made (e.g., clutter, incorrect chart types, misleading scales).

- **Transform it into a good visualization** by fixing the issues (e.g., choosing appropriate chart types, improving labels, making the design cleaner and more readable).
- Submit both the original **bad** visualization and your **good** version, along with a brief explanation of the changes you made and how they improved the visualization.

### 3. Create Your Own Good and Bad Visualizations Using the Provided Movie Dataset
- Using the provided movie dataset, create:
  - One **good** visualization that follows data visualization best practices (e.g., clear labeling, appropriate chart type, clean design).
  - One **bad** visualization that uses poor design choices (e.g., incorrect chart type, cluttered design, misleading information).

- **Dataset Columns**: The movie dataset contains the following columns:
  - **Title**: The title of the movie.
  - **Released_Year**: The year the movie was released.
  - **Certificate**: The rating or certificate assigned to the movie based on its content (e.g., G, PG, R).
  - **Runtime**: The duration of the movie in minutes.
  - **Genre**: The primary genre(s) of the movie (e.g., Drama, Comedy, Action). Some movies have multiple genres.
  - **IMDB_Rating**: The average rating of the movie as voted by IMDb users, on a scale of 1 to 10.
  - **Overview**: A brief description or synopsis of the movie’s plot or storyline.
  - **Meta_score**: A score derived from Metacritic, aggregating critic reviews to rate the movie on a scale of 0 to 100.
  - **Director**: The director of the movie, responsible for overseeing the creative aspects of the film.
  - **Stars**: The main actors/actresses in the movie, with up to four stars listed (e.g., Star1, Star2, Star3, Star4).
  - **Votes**: The total number of user ratings the movie received on IMDb.
  - **Gross**: The total worldwide box office earnings for the movie, typically in US dollars.


- You can create visualizations based on attributes like:
  - IMDb ratings vs. genres.
  - Gross revenue by release year.
  - Top directors by the number of movies or average ratings.
  - Popular stars based on votes.

- **Tools**: You may use **Tableau**, code in **D3.js** (if you feel comfortable with it), or even **design the visualizations on a tablet or paper**.

- Write a short reflection for each visualization:
  - **Good Visualization**: Explain why this visualization is effective and what best practices you followed.
  - **Bad Visualization**: Describe the flaws in the bad visualization and why it hinders understanding.

### 4. Submission Instructions
- Submit a **single file** (PDF) containing:
  - The screenshots and analyses for both the found good and bad visualizations (Section 1 & 2).
  - Your own **good** and **bad** visualizations based on the movie dataset.
  - A reflection for each visualization you created (good and bad).

- Ensure your file is named as follows:
  - **Assignment4_FirstNameLastName.pdf**

### 5. Upload the PDF to Canvas
- Upload the PDF file to the **Assignment 4** submission page on Canvas.

## Some Tips:
- Start simple! Focus on clarity and make sure your visualizations are easy to interpret.
- Avoid common pitfalls in bad visualizations like clutter, unclear labels, and improper chart types.
- Experiment with different visualization tools or even try sketching ideas on paper to improve your understanding of design principles.
