## Objective

In this assignment, you will explore the concepts of good and bad data visualizations. You will find, analyze, and transform visualizations, followed by creating your own visualizations using the provided movie dataset. The goal is to understand what makes a visualization effective and how poor design choices can lead to misinterpretation.

## Instructions

### 1. Find One Good Visualization and Turn It into a Bad One

- Find an example of a **good** data visualization from any public source (e.g., [Data Is Beautiful Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/), [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/graphics), books, or articles).
- Include a **screenshot** of this visualization in your report and write a brief analysis explaining:
  - Why it’s effective.
  - What design principles are being followed.
  - How the visualization communicates the data clearly and efficiently.
  - Use the design principles from the lectures so far.

- **Transform it into a bad visualization** by intentionally introducing poor design choices (e.g., improper chart types, bad labels, misleading colors, evil intentions, being hyper partisan).
- Submit both the original **good** visualization and your **bad** version, along with a brief explanation of the changes you made and why these changes lead to a poor visualization.
- You can use Figma, Illustrator, or pen and paper for your visualizations. Make sure the result is clear and presentable.

### 2. Find One Bad Visualization and Turn It into a Good One

- Find an example of a **bad** data visualization from any public source for example [Data Is Ugly Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/). Look into YouTube journalism accounts, many of them will have vis. Make sure to include the source of the visualization. Most of the places you find bad vis, already will have explanations on why a vis is bad. But you are an expert now, so your description should reflect your expertise in visualization.
- Include a **screenshot** of this visualization in your report and write a brief analysis explaining:

  - Why it’s ineffective or misleading.
  - What poor design choices are being made (e.g., clutter, incorrect chart types, misleading scales).

- **Transform it into a good visualization** by fixing the issues (e.g., choosing appropriate chart types, improving labels, making the design cleaner and more readable).
- Submit both the original **bad** visualization and your **good** version, along with a brief explanation of the changes you made and how they improved the visualization.

### 3. Use AI to Create a Dataset and Make Good and Bad Visualizations

- Ask an AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to generate a **fake dataset**. You should specify the columns, format, and data types needed.
- Using this dataset, create:
  - One **good** visualization following data visualization best practices.
  - One **bad** visualization using poor design choices.

- **Tools**: You may use **Tableau**, code in **D3.js** (if you're comfortable with it), or even design the visualizations on **tablet or paper**. You can also ask the AI to create the visualization, but ensure that you manually introduce the design choices (X-axis, Y-axis, scale type, data type, encoding, etc)  to make it bad or good.

- Write a short reflection for each visualization:
  - **Good Visualization**: Explain why this visualization is effective and what best practices you followed.
  - **Bad Visualization**: Describe the flaws in the bad visualization and why it hinders understanding.
- **Submit what you asked the AI**, along with the dataset it generated.

### 4. Submission Instructions

- Submit a **single file** (PDF) containing:
  - The screenshots and analyses for both the found good and bad visualizations (Section 1 & 2).
  - Your own **good** and **bad** visualizations based on the AI-generated dataset.
  - A reflection for each visualization you created (good and bad).
  - A copy of the AI-generated dataset and the prompt you used to generate it.

- Ensure your file is named as follows:  
  **Assignment4_FirstNameLastName.pdf**

### 5. Upload the PDF to Canvas

- Upload the PDF file to the **Assignment 4** submission page on Canvas.

## Some Tips:

- Start simple! Focus on clarity and make sure your visualizations are easy to interpret.
- Apply your storytelling skills. Be creative. Have fun.
- Avoid common pitfalls in bad visualizations like clutter, unclear labels, and improper chart types.
- Experiment with different visualization tools or even try sketching ideas on paper to improve your understanding of design principles.
