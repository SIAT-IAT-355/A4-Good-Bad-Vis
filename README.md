**Due Date:** October 22nd, 11:59 PM

## Objective

In this assignment, you will explore the concepts of good and bad data visualizations. You will find, analyze, and transform visualizations, followed by creating your own visualizations using the provided movie dataset. The goal is to understand what makes a visualization effective and how poor design choices can lead to misinterpretation.

## Instructions

### 1. Find One Good Visualization and Turn It into a Bad One

- Find an example of a **good** data visualization from any public source (e.g., [Data Is Beautiful Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/), [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/graphics), Other books, and articles).
- Include a **screenshot** of this visualization in your report and write a brief analysis explaining:

  - Why it’s effective.
  - What design principles are being followed.
  - How the visualization communicates the data clearly and efficiently.
  - Use the lectures you've seen so far.

- **Transform it into a bad visualization** by intentionally introducing poor design choices (e.g., improper chart types, bad labels, misleading colors, evil intentions, being hyper partisan).
- Submit both the original **good** visualization and your **bad** version, along with a brief explanation of the changes you made and why they lead to a poor visualization.
- You can use Figma, Illustrator, or pen an paper for your vis. Try to deliver a clean result.

### 2. Find One Bad Visualization and Turn It into a Good One

- Find an example of a **bad** data visualization from any public source for exampple [Data Is Ugly Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/). Include the source of where you found the vis and explain why it is bad.
- Include a **screenshot** of this visualization in your report and write a brief analysis explaining:

  - Why it’s ineffective or misleading.
  - What poor design choices are being made (e.g., clutter, incorrect chart types, misleading scales).

- **Transform it into a good visualization** by fixing the issues (e.g., choosing appropriate chart types, improving labels, making the design cleaner and more readable).
- Submit both the original **bad** visualization and your **good** version, along with a brief explanation of the changes you made and how they improved the visualization.

### 3. Ask AI (Chatgpt, Gemini, or anything) to make a dataset for you and make a good and bad visualization out of it

Generate a fake dataset using AI. You should describe the columns you need and tell it what format and data types it should include.

Make a good and bad visualization using this dataset.

- **Tools**: You may use **Tableau**, code in **D3.js** (if you feel comfortable with it), or even **design the visualizations on a tablet or paper**, you can even ask the AI to make the vis for you. But you can't ask it to make it good. You should give it the propper vis lingo, X axis, Y axis, scale type, data type, encoding, etc.

- Write a short reflection for each visualization:
  - **Good Visualization**: Explain why this visualization is effective and what best practices you followed.
  - **Bad Visualization**: Describe the flaws in the bad visualization and why it hinders understanding.
- Submit what you asked the AI.

### 4. Submission Instructions

- Submit a **single file** (PDF) containing:

  - The screenshots and analyses for both the found good and bad visualizations (Section 1 & 2).
  - Your own **good** and **bad** visualizations based on the movie dataset.
  - A reflection for each visualization you created (good and bad).

- Ensure your file is named as follows:
  - **Assignment4_FirstNameLastName.pdf**

### 5. Upload the PDF to Canvas

- Upload the PDF file to the **Assignment 4** submission page on Canvas.

## Some Tips:

- Start simple! Focus on clarity and make sure your visualizations are easy to interpret.
- Apply your storytelling skills. Be creative. Have fun.
- Avoid common pitfalls in bad visualizations like clutter, unclear labels, and improper chart types.
- Experiment with different visualization tools or even try sketching ideas on paper to improve your understanding of design principles.
